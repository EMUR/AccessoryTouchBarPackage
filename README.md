A swift package that introduces the MacOS touchbar concept to iOS/iPadOS devices.

</br>

## üöÄ Installation

### Swift Package Manager
Adding AccessoryTouchBar support to your app is very easy. You will just need to add this into the dependencies value of your ```Package.swift```.
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/EMUR/AccessoryTouchBarPackage.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## üì≤ Usage
The touchbar supports `UITextField` and `UITextView`, to add it to any of your app's text fields, you will simply just call `.addTouchBarSupport()` on your text field and the touchbar will be automatically added on top of the keyboard. 

</br>The following code is an example of a text field `myTextField` with touchbar support:

```swift
var myTextField = UITextField()
myTextField.addTouchBarSupport()
```

</br>By default, you text field will support all of the touchbar functionalities. To specify which options to present, you can simply specify that in the options parameter for the function, like the following:

```swift
var myTextView = UITextView()
myTextView.addTouchBarSupport(options: [.emailDomains, .zoom, .formatText, .hideKeyboard, .copyToClipboard, .pasteFromClipboard, .numberPad])
```

This will allow `myTextField` to only show the options specified, you can customize the options per text field to provide the best user experience.

‚òùÔ∏è *The package was build with modularity in mind, so you can create your own custom options and enhance existing ones.*
